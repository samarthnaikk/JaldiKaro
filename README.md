# JaldiKaro

**JaldiKaro** (Hindi: "Do It Quickly") is a visual, no-code website builder that enables developers and designers to rapidly prototype and generate full-stack web applications through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

JaldiKaro combines the visual design capabilities of tools like Figma with the backend flow orchestration of platforms like n8n, providing a unified canvas for building complete web applications. The platform allows you to:

- **Design UI visually**: Drag and drop form elements, buttons, text, images, and containers onto a canvas
- **Configure database mappings**: Connect form fields directly to database tables and columns
- **Build backend flows**: Create API endpoints, validation rules, and database connections
- **Generate code automatically**: Export complete website specifications with database schemas and element mappings

### Key Features

- 🎨 **Visual Design Canvas**: Figma-style drag-and-drop interface for UI elements
- 📋 **Rich Form Elements**: Input fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and text areas
- 🗄️ **Database Integration**: Map form elements to database tables and columns
- 🔌 **API Flow Builder**: Define backend endpoints and data flows
- 📊 **Auto-generate Schema**: Automatically create SQL database schemas from form mappings
- 📄 **Multi-page Support**: Design multiple pages and define navigation flows
- 📦 **Export Reports**: Generate detailed reports with element specifications and connections

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18.2.0
- React Flow 11.11.4 (visual canvas)
- React Scripts 5.0.1

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express 4.18.2
- CORS support

**Development:**
- Concurrently (run client and server simultaneously)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.0 or higher)
- **npm** (v6.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samarthnaikk/JaldiKaro.git
   cd JaldiKaro
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   This will automatically install dependencies for both the client and server using the postinstall script.

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)

Run both the client and server concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Client** on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Server** on `http://localhost:3001`

#### Run Individually

**Client only:**
```bash
npm start --prefix client
```

**Server only:**
```bash
npm start --prefix server
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Creating a Website

1. **Start the application** using `npm run dev`
2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Choose your mode**:
   - **Design Tab**: Add and configure UI elements
   - **Backend Flow Tab**: Define API endpoints and database connections

### Adding UI Elements

1. Click on any element from the sidebar (Input Field, Dropdown, Button, etc.)
2. Configure the element properties in the modal dialog
3. Drag elements to position them on the canvas
4. Connect elements by dragging from the connection handle

### Database Mapping

When adding form elements:
1. Enter the **Table Name** (e.g., `users`, `products`)
2. Enter the **Column Name** (e.g., `username`, `email`)
3. Mark as **Required** if the field is mandatory

### Generating Output

1. Design your pages and add form elements
2. Configure database mappings and backend flows
3. Click the **"Generate Website"** button
4. Check the server terminal for the output report
5. Find the generated `all_page.txt` file in the `server/` directory

### Output Format

The generated report includes:
- **Pages Overview**: All pages with dimensions and positions
- **Form Elements**: Complete list of inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.
- **UI Elements**: Buttons, text, images, and containers
- **API Endpoints**: Backend routes and methods
- **Database Connections**: Connection strings and mappings
- **Element Connections**: Relationships between frontend and backend
- **Auto-generated SQL Schema**: CREATE TABLE statements based on form mappings
- **Statistics Summary**: Count of all elements and connections
